iLike
=====

A shopping search engine built to truly combine textual features from web pages, and visual features from image content for better image search in a vertical search engine. This system was tested based on data collected from Macy's website and a crawler was built using Java and Selenium to crawl data from Macy's website. The iLike system was built using PHP.
